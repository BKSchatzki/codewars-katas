// This function returns the opposite of the given number. For example, if given 10 returns -10.

function opposite(number) {
  // Assign new value to number, by multiplying by two and subtracting it.
  number = number - (number * 2);
  return number;
}

// Clearly I could have just returned -number, but oh well.
